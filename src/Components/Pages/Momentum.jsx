      <p className="pb-5">Here I am, seated before my computer, weary and restless, wondering what
       actions should I take for me to be good at expressing my thoughts through writing. I'm fully
        aware that my vocabularies are limited and this is also my first time writing about my thoughts
         and experience but what&apos;s more important for me is I&apos;m finally taking my first step in improving
          how to share my ideas.</p>

      <p>Before I dive into something new, there&apos;s this quote I always 
        remember: &quot;Take risks, make mistakes. That&apos;s how you grow. Pain nourishes your courage. You have
         to fail in order to practice being brave&quot; -Mary Tyler Moore. Many of
          us have experienced similar feelings at some stage, but it&apos;s through
           our mistakes that we truly learn and evolve. This gentle reminder
            gives me the power to overcome my fear of making mistakes. This is
             a short and worthwhile read. These were the quotes that made a 
             huge impact on me</p>
